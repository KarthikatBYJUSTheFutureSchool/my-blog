<p>I loved the movie a lot 
  As I am a great fan of marvel
  Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbinding and surely an enthralling experience. The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favorite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off. The directors, Anthony and Joe Russo have made sure that it delivers an unforgettable experience. Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have come up with a screenplay full of epic and unpredictable moments. The film has a great balance of humor, emotions, and action. The biggest strength of the film is the emotions. This is the most emotional superhero film I have ever seen. It's just perfect. The action sequences were jaw-dropping. The climactic battle left me amazed. It's just filled with memorable moments and cannot be described with words. The visuals are gorgeous and have a great impact on the film. The humor doesn't look exaggerated and manages to entertain throughout the film. The plot twists were very impressive and suspenseful. The film features many cameos of characters from the previous MCU films, which just gives a double dose of excitement. The background score gives me goosebumps, though I've listened to it several times. It was really clever to make changes to the characterization of the Hulk. I enjoyed that a lot. But the show-stealer is Robert Downey Jr, who plays the role of Tony Stark/Iron Man. The man who started it all proves yet again that there's no one else who can perfect his role. Do not miss his powerful moments in the final battle.

    <p>What can I say that already hasn't been said about this amazing film!?
      It's a beautiful, emotional, hilarious, stunning, and just eye opening of a film. Now for someone like me who to be honest, wasn't really into Spider Man at first, this movie is what made Spider Man become my favorite super hero (Even though I didn't really watch any of his movies before) But I'm getting ahead of myself, the story of the film is a teenager by the name of Miles Morales going through a coming of age story and becoming Spider Man as other Spider people come from different dimensions and try to make their way back home and stop this villain called the Collider. And would have to say that Miles is one of the best protagonist's I've seen in a film in the last couple years. He's relatable, funny, and just a character you want to see succeed by the end. But all of the side characters are also very likable. Usually characters like fathers in animated films can be sometimes annoying like Simba in The Lion King 2: Simba's pride, but he isn't and is a likable character. I was kinda nervous about the other Spider people thing that it would be too weird, but somehow it was very well handled. I loved all of them, though if I had to pick a favorite out of them I would say that Spider Ham is my favorite. I just love how he's in a more 2d style compared to the other characters but doesn't look completely out of place. Speaking of the animation it is some of the best animation I have ever seen. It feels like a perfect combination of something like 3d and 2d and it is just gorgeous to look at. And I loved the music, Sunflower mainly. Sunflower still a couple years later still gets stuck in my head, but all of the other music choices fit the scenes very well.
